MySQL storage engines are components that handle the management of data storage and retrieval in MySQL database systems. Different storage engines have different features and functionality, allowing users to choose the one that best fits their needs. Here are some of the most commonly used storage engines in MySQL:

1- MyISAM:
This is the default storage engine for MySQL versions prior to 5.5. MyISAM is a non-transactional storage engine that provides fast read performance for large datasets. It is well-suited for read-heavy applications and is commonly used for websites that serve mostly static content.

2-InnoDB:
InnoDB is a transactional storage engine that provides support for transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys. It is the default storage engine for MySQL versions 5.5 and later, and is well-suited for applications that require data integrity and high concurrency.

3-Memory:
The Memory storage engine stores tables in memory rather than on disk, providing extremely fast read and write performance. However, since data is not persisted to disk, it is not suitable for storing large datasets or for applications that require data durability.

4-Archive:
The Archive storage engine is designed for storing large amounts of data in a compact format. It is well-suited for applications that require infrequent access to historical data, and it provides fast insert performance.

5-CSV:
The CSV storage engine stores data in comma-separated value (CSV) format, making it easy to import and export data from MySQL. However, it does not support indexes or other advanced features.

6-NDB:
The NDB storage engine, also known as MySQL Cluster, is designed for high availability and scalability. It is a distributed storage engine that allows data to be stored across multiple nodes, providing automatic failover and load balancing.

7-Blackhole:
The Blackhole storage engine is essentially a "null" storage engine that discards all data that is written to it. It is useful for creating replication slaves that do not need to store data, as it allows changes to be propagated to the slave without actually writing any data.

8-Federated:
The Federated storage engine allows you to create tables that reference data stored on a remote MySQL server. This can be useful for distributed applications that need to access data from multiple servers.

9-TokuDB:
The TokuDB storage engine is a high-performance, transactional storage engine that provides fast insert and query performance, particularly for large datasets. It uses a fractal tree index structure that allows for efficient compression and high-speed queries.

1 0-RocksDB:
The RocksDB storage engine is a high-performance, persistent key-value store that is optimized for solid-state drives (SSDs). It provides fast write performance and low latency for random reads
